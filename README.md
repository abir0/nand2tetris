# nand2tetris

[Nand2Tetris](http://www.nand2tetris.org/) is an awesome course on understanding how computers work, how low to high level programming languages works on top of computers and most importantly how to apply computer science by abtraction. I highly recommend this course and the associated projects to anyone interested in computing and stuff. 

This repo will contain my projects on the software side of the course. Namely assembler, compiler etc.
